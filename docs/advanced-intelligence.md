# Advanced Intelligence Boundaries

Pod Tracker's recommendation features are SQL-scoped and heuristic by
default. They should stay useful without pgvector, external AI services,
or unrestricted natural-language SQL generation.

## Current Recommendation Types

- Pod generation uses SQL-backed candidate data plus deterministic scoring
  and a bounded optimizer.
- Similar deck recommendations use visible latest decklists, commander,
  archetype, bracket, color identity, and tags.
- Collection-aware deck suggestions use only collections and decks visible
  to the requesting user, then return aggregate coverage and reason labels.

These paths are not semantic or AI-backed. They must keep working on a
plain PostgreSQL install with the required extensions listed in
`BUILD.md`.

## Optional pgvector Semantic Search

`pgvector` support is optional and local. The default SQLx migrations do
not create the extension or any vector tables, and the application keeps
using SQL/full-text/trigram and heuristic recommendations when pgvector
is absent.

The explicit local setup path is:

```sh
just pgvector-migrate-up
```

That recipe applies only `crates/pod-db/optional-migrations/pgvector/`
against `POD_TRACKER_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` or
`POD_TRACKER_DATABASE_URL`. The optional migration creates the `vector`
extension plus `search.card_semantic_embeddings` and
`search.deck_semantic_embeddings`. It stores model names, dimensions,
vectors, and source text hashes, but not raw embedding source text.

- Do not add `create extension vector` to default migrations.
- Gate vector schema, indexes, jobs, and queries behind an explicit local
  setup path or separate optional migration.
- Preserve SQL and heuristic recommendation behavior as the default and
  test the app without pgvector.
- Keep embeddings local or document every external provider boundary
  before any network-backed embedding job exists.
- Never embed private notes, invite tokens, host addresses, emails, phone
  numbers, production logs, or database dumps.

`SemanticSearchRepository` checks for the extension and optional tables at
runtime. Card and deck semantic searches return empty results when
pgvector is unavailable, when the optional tables are absent, or when the
query embedding is invalid. Deck semantic search still scopes candidates
to decks visible to the requesting user before returning results.

The optional tables use pgvector's variable-dimension `vector` type so a
self-hosted instance can choose its local embedding model. Add a
model-specific HNSW expression index only after choosing a model and
dimension; the optional migration includes commented examples.

## Natural-Language Meta Query Research

Unrestricted natural-language-to-SQL is risky for this product because the
database contains host addresses, RSVP details, notes, invite tokens,
calendar scope, and other sensitive playgroup data. A generated query can
also bypass carefully scoped repository methods if it is allowed to run
against raw tables.

The safe direction is a constrained catalog of approved meta queries
rather than open-ended NL-to-SQL:

- Map plain-language prompts to a fixed catalog of approved query shapes.
- Require each query to declare viewer scope, inputs, safe output columns,
  redacted sample data, and expected indexes.
- Execute through existing repository/service methods or security-barrier
  views, not arbitrary model-generated SQL.
- Refuse prompts that request private addresses, contact details, invite
  tokens, raw notes, logs, backups, or cross-playgroup data.
- Log only query ids, route family, request id, and high-level refusal
  reasons.

This keeps meta exploration inspectable and PostgreSQL-first while
preserving the privacy boundaries documented in `docs/privacy.md`.
