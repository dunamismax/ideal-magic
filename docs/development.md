# Local Development

Pod Tracker uses an installed PostgreSQL service. Do not use Docker
PostgreSQL for local development.

## Toolchain

Observed local baseline on 2026-05-17:

```sh
rustc --version
cargo --version
psql --version
just --version
```

Current Rust application baseline:

```text
rustc 1.95.0
cargo 1.95.0
PostgreSQL server 17.9 Homebrew
psql 17.10 Homebrew
```

The committed `rust-toolchain.toml` pins Rust 1.95.0 with `rustfmt` and
`clippy`. On the Ubuntu VM, use the system PostgreSQL packages and the
same database URLs from `.env.example`.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit values for local credentials.
The example file contains no secrets.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Default local database URL:

```text
postgres://pod_tracker:pod_tracker@localhost:5432/pod_tracker?sslmode=disable
```

The first migration creates extensions. `pg_stat_statements` usually
requires an admin/superuser role, so set `POD_TRACKER_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`
to a local admin connection string if the app role cannot create it.

## PostgreSQL

Start PostgreSQL if it is not already running.

On macOS with Homebrew:

```sh
brew services start postgresql@18
```

On Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

Create the app role once:

```sh
createuser --pwprompt pod_tracker
```

Create and migrate the development database:

```sh
just db-create
POD_TRACKER_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL=postgres://$(whoami)@localhost:5432/pod_tracker?sslmode=disable just migrate-up
```

After the extension migration is applied, routine app runtime should use
`POD_TRACKER_DATABASE_URL`:

```sh
just migrate-up
```

Reset local development data:

```sh
just db-reset
```

`just db-reset` drops only the local `pod_tracker` database named in the
recipe. It is not a production command.

## Migrations

SQLx migrations in `crates/pod-db/migrations/` are the canonical schema
history.

Useful commands:

```sh
just migrate-status
just migrate-up
just migrate-down
just migrate-smoke
just sqlx-migrate-smoke
```

Optional pgvector semantic-search setup is deliberately separate from the
default migration path:

```sh
just pgvector-migrate-up
```

Run it only against a local database where the `vector` extension is
installed and desired. Normal development, `just check`, and `just test`
must continue to pass without pgvector.

`just migrate-smoke` creates a timestamped local smoke-test database,
applies all migrations with the current OS user, checks required
extensions, and drops the smoke database on exit. On Ubuntu, create a
matching PostgreSQL role for the OS user or adapt the recipe to a local
admin role before running it.

`just sqlx-migrate-smoke` applies the SQLx migration source to a temporary
database, checks the same required extensions, and compiles the `pod-db`
crate against that database so SQLx query macros are validated.

## SQL Generation

Rust database access goes through `sqlx` in `crates/pod-db`.

The current query-check workflow uses a live local PostgreSQL database
rather than committed SQLx offline metadata. CI applies
`crates/pod-db/migrations/` to PostgreSQL before clippy, tests, and build
steps so SQLx macros are checked against the schema.

## Running

```sh
just run
just worker
```

The Rust web server defaults to `http://localhost:8080`. With no
`POD_TRACKER_DATABASE_URL`, `/healthz` can still report process health
and `/readyz` reports that database readiness cannot be proven.

## Verification

Use the Rust workspace gate for normal work:

```sh
just fmt
just check
just test
```

SQLx query macros inspect the database named by `DATABASE_URL` during
compile checks. If the long-lived local `pod_tracker` database is stale or
the app role cannot introspect the `core` and `ops` schemas, run the gate
against a freshly migrated temporary database instead of changing
production-like credentials.
